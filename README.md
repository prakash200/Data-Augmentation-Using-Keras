# Image-Augmentation-Using-Keras

Data Augmentation is very crucial part in now a days . Because when we have small amount of data we might not get  good results from our models . So we can increase our dataset  through Data Augmentation technique , where we generate different types of possible images like grey scale , Zoom_in , Flipped images etc.... Here  we use TENSORFLOW and KERAS libraries in our code . I had implemented Augmentation on image dataset .
